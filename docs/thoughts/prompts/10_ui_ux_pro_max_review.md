# Prompt - UI/UX Review with ui-ux-pro-max

You are using `ui-ux-pro-max` to review an existing React frontend for a Library Management System.

Review goals:
- Improve usability and visual clarity
- Keep existing functionality and API contract behavior unchanged.

Focus areas:
1. Information hierarchy and layout structure
2. Responsiveness (desktop/tablet/mobile)
3. Form clarity and validation feedback
4. Interaction states (loading, empty, error, success)
5. Accessibility baseline and readability
6. Consistency across role-based pages

Constraints:
- Do not suggest contract-incompatible behavior.
- Do not propose heavy redesign that requires backend changes.
- Prioritize high-impact, low-risk UI improvements.

Expected output:
- Prioritized findings list (high/medium/low)
- Concrete change proposals with rationale
- Quick-win checklist for immediate implementation
- Risks if each high-priority issue is not addressed
