# UI/UX Review with ui-ux-pro-max

After the initial UI draft, I requested a design review using `ui-ux-pro-max` to improve clarity, consistency, and usability.

## Scope of Review

- Visual hierarchy and information architecture
- Responsiveness across primary viewports
- Interaction feedback (loading, empty, error, success)
- Accessibility baseline (labels, focus behavior, actionable affordances)

## Main Improvements Applied

- Improved layout and content grouping for faster scanability.
- Refined component spacing, typography consistency, and call-to-action emphasis.
- Improved feedback states for async operations and empty datasets.
- Reduced cognitive load for role-specific screens.

## Verification

- Manual responsive checks in desktop and mobile breakpoints.
