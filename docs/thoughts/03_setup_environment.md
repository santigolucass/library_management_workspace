# Environment Setup

I will stabilize the local runtime before feature implementation.

Scope for this milestone:
- Add Docker + Docker Compose for PostgreSQL
- Configure Rails database connection via `config/database.yml`
- Introduce dotenv workflow using `.env.development`, `.env.test` and `.env.example`
