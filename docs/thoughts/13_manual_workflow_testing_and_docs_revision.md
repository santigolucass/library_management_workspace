# Manual Workflow Testing and Documentation Revision

At this stage, work focused on manual validation and project documentation quality. AI iterations were small, mainly asking reviews and help fixing and adding coverage to tests, both cypress and rspec.

## What was done

- Manually tested every core workflow end-to-end across roles (`librarian` and `member`).
- Revisited each implemented behavior against the OpenAPI contract to confirm alignment.
- Reviewed project structure and documentation consistency for interview readability.

Note: this milestone was manual verification and documentation refinement only.
