# Manual Workflow Testing and Documentation Revision

At this stage, work focused on manual validation and project documentation quality.

## What was done

- Manually tested every core workflow end-to-end across roles (`librarian` and `member`).
- Revisited each implemented behavior against the OpenAPI contract to confirm alignment.
- Reviewed project structure and documentation consistency for interview readability.

Note: this milestone was manual verification and documentation refinement only.
